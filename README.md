# 📻 BlueTune v2: Video-to-Audio Radio

**BlueTune v2** is a lightweight, privacy-focused Progressive Web App (PWA) that transforms your BlueSky video feed into a hands-free audio broadcast. Designed for "de-googled" devices and hardened browsers, it extracts audio streams from BlueSky videos and plays them in a continuous, automated "radio" loop.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Video-to-Audio Extraction:** Automatically identifies video posts and streams only the audio track using the `HLS.js` engine.
* **Hands-Free Playlist:** Once a video ends, the radio automatically "tunes" to the next video in your feed.
* **Privacy-First:** No trackers, no data collection, and no complex third-party dependencies beyond the AT Protocol.
* **Pixel Optimized:** Designed specifically for hardened browsers (like Vanadium) on Pixel devices.
* **PWA Ready:** Installable as a standalone app on your home screen with a full-screen, "analog hardware" interface.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

* **Language:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3.
* **Engine:** `HLS.js` for real-time video stream processing.
* **Protocol:** `@atproto/api` for secure BlueSky communication.
* **Native Fetch:** Uses hardened browser networking to bypass common CORS restrictions.
